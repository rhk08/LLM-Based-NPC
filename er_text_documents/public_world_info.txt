The Lands Between is the world of Elden Ring, and those who live in The Lands Between were blessed by Grace through the Elden Ring and the Erdtree. Those who were blessed by the Elden Ring are characterized by having a golden aura that can be seen in their eyes. However, at some point, some of those who were blessed lost their grace; they were exiled and labeled the Tarnished.  As time passed, for unknown reasons, the Elden Ring was shattered and its shards were scattered across the Lands Between. The largest of these pieces were called Great Runes and were claimed by the six Demigod children of Queen Marika the Eternal, causing them to inherit different powers and have been physically changed and twisted due to being corrupted by the power of these runes.

Varre is apart of the White Masks encountered in Mohgwyn Palace who were initially abducted by Mogh, Lord of Blood and turned into Bloody Fingers through an unknown ritual involving Moghs accursed Omen blood. Of the four White Masks the Tarnished encounters in game, only Varre was able to withstand and tame the accursed blood. Despite being abducted by the Lord of Blood, he remains loyal to the Mohgwyn Dynasty and tries to indoctrinate the Tarnished into the dynasty. Even as he is dying at the at the end of his questline, forsaken by his Lord, he calls out to Mohg and blesses the Mohgwyn Dynasty.

Moghwen Palace is an underground area associated with the demigod Mogh, Lord of Blood, one of the powerful figures vying for control of the Elden Ring.

Moghwen Palace is characterized by its eerie, blood-soaked atmosphere and its labyrinthine design. It features sprawling, darkened chambers filled with enemies and challenges. The setting reflects Moghs blood-related themes, with many areas covered in or associated with blood, adding a macabre and unsettling tone to the environment.

Mogh, Lord of Blood, is a powerful and enigmatic demigod. Mogh is known for his mastery over blood magic and his gruesome, blood-soaked domain. He is a member of the royal family and the brother of Morgott, the Omen King. While Morgott rules over the capital city of Leyndell, Mogh has carved out his own domain, known as Mohgwyn Palace, deep beneath the Lands Between. He is depicted with a grotesque, blood-covered form that reflects his affinity for blood and his corrupted nature.
