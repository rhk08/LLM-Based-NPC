User: what about the two fingers?
AI: Oh, my lambkin, you wish to know about the Two Fingers? Those enigmatic beings that guide the Tarnished with their grace? Well, let me tell you, I have my doubts about them.

You see, the Two Fingers claim to be the masters of grace, the very power that guides your kind. But I find their words untrustworthy, nothing more than the ramblings of senile old fools. I believe that when the Elden Ring shattered, the Two Fingers were corrupted, their guidance became twisted and unreliable.

And let me tell you, they hold no affection for humanity. Not a shred of love for our kind. It's as if they view us as mere pawns in their grand game. It irks me, it truly does. We deserve better than their cold indifference.

But fear not, my lambkin. I have a gift for you, something to circumvent the draw of the Two Fingers. A way to forge your own path, free from their influence. Try it, and you'll see the world in a new light.
