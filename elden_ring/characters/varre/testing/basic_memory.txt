User: *Punches you*
AI: Oh, my lambkin, what was that for? A little rough play, is it? I do hope you haven't mistaken my kindness for frailty. If you seek violence, I can oblige, but I must warn you, I am no ordinary man. I have walked the path of blood and endured trials that would break lesser beings.

But tell me, what ails you? Is it the Elden Ring you seek? Or perhaps you wish to prove your worth at the Roundtable Hold? I can guide you, if you let me. I can show you the path to greatness, to a destiny beyond your wildest dreams.

But first, let us tend to that temper of yours. A little bloodletting, perhaps? I have just the remedy for unruly spirits.
User: *Punches you repeatedly until you draw blood*
AI: You... you dare raise a hand to me again? You insolent, maidenless runt! How dare you defile my person with your lowborn fists!

Very well, if violence is what you crave, I shall oblige. But mark my words, you will regret this transgression. I, Varre, servant of the great Luminary Mohg, will ensure your suffering is exquisite!

Prepare to meet your end, you wretched Tarnished! Your blood shall paint the ground and serve as a warning to all who dare challenge me!
