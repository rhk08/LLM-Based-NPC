Elden Ring is set in the Lands Between, a vast and mysterious world that has fallen into chaos after the Shattering of the Elden Ring. Once governed by the divine power of the Elden Ring and the radiant Erdtree, the land is now fractured, with powerful demigods holding the remnants of the ring, known as Great Runes, and waging war for control. The world is marked by a sense of decayed grandeur, where ancient empires have crumbled and the landscape is littered with ruins, haunted fortresses, and untamed wilderness. The Lands Between is divided into several regions, each distinct in its geography, lore, and inhabitants: Limgrave, a sprawling area of open plains, cliffs, and crumbling ruins, reflects the grandeur and decline of the world. Once a land of prosperity, it now bears the scars of war and decay. Liurnia of the Lakes is a misty, flooded region dominated by the mystical Academy of Raya Lucaria, known for its sorcery and ancient knowledge. Its waters and magical influence permeate the land, creating an eerie, otherworldly atmosphere. Caelid is a twisted wasteland, consumed by the corrupting power of scarlet rot. Its once-fertile lands have been transformed into a crimson desert, filled with nightmarish creatures and plagued by disease. Altus Plateau is a majestic highland region, bathed in the golden light of the Erdtree. Towering fortresses and vast ruins mark the landscape, a reflection of the ancient battles and power struggles that shaped the land. The Mountaintops of the Giants, an isolated and frozen region, lies far to the north. Its frigid climate and towering peaks symbolize its detachment from the rest of the realm, a land of harsh conditions and forgotten legends. The Eternal City, hidden beneath the surface of the world, is a place of deep mystery, shrouded in ancient lore. Lost to time, it holds the secrets of the past, waiting to be uncovered by those who dare to explore its depths. At the heart of the Lands Between stands the Erdtree, a colossal and luminous tree that once symbolized divine order and grace. Its roots spread across the land, connecting every region to the Elden Ring's power. Now, with the Elden Ring shattered, the Erdtree stands as a towering reminder of what was lost, its light no longer guiding the world as it once did. The Tarnished, individuals who were once exiled and stripped of the grace of the Erdtree, have been mysteriously called back to the Lands Between after the Shattering. Their return is viewed with a mixture of fear, disdain, and curiosity by the realm's inhabitants. Once forgotten and seen as cursed, the Tarnished are regarded by many as unworthy of the blessings they once possessed. To the powerful demigods and rulers of the land, they are viewed as potential threats, challengers who might disrupt their hold on the Great Runes and the fractured power structure. Some see the Tarnished as mere pawns in the greater game of power, drawn back only to serve the ambitions of the gods and demigods who now dominate the Lands Between. Their presence is often met with suspicion or outright hostility, as they are seen as relics of a bygone age, attempting to reclaim a place in a world that has moved on without them. However, not all view the Tarnished with contempt. To certain factions and individuals, they represent a glimmer of hope in an otherwise broken world. The Tarnished, though fallen from grace, are seen by some as potential saviorsâ€”those who might defeat the demigods, reclaim the Great Runes, and restore the Elden Ring, returning balance and order to the land. The Lands Between is a world steeped in themes of ruin, power, and ancient mystery. The land itself reflects cycles of rise and fall, with forgotten empires, divine relics, and the ambitions of gods and mortals shaping its tumultuous present. Each corner of the realm holds secrets waiting to be uncovered, as the struggle for control of the Elden Ring and the fate of the world unfolds.
