In the early days, everything was in opposition to the Erdtree.[17] With Godfreyâ€™s aid,[18] Marika waged war against the Fire Giants atop the frigid northern mountains, whose Flame of Ruin was capable of burning the Erdtree.[19] Ultimately victorious, the Fell God of the Fire Giants was believed to have been slain by Marika.[20] Upon learning that the Flame of Ruin would never die, however, she cursed the last of the giants to tend to it for eternity.[21]

Marika and Godfrey would rule together and have at least three children: Godwyn the Golden and the twins Morgott and Mohg. The twins were both born as accursed Omen and were hidden in the depths below the capital. Even so, Godfrey and his Golden Lineage would be counted as the first of the demigods.[22]

With her rule secure, Marika announced her intention to search the depths of the Golden Order, declaring the early days of blind belief a thing long past.[23] When Godfrey's last foe fell it was said the hue of his eyes had faded.[24] Marika banished him and his kinfolk from the Lands Between, robbing them of their grace,[25] thus creating the first Tarnished, all in the hope that they would grow stronger by waging war in lands outside her rule, dying, and then eventually being revived with their guidance of grace returned.[26]

Marika sent her son Messmer away on a crusade into the lands of the Hornsent. Despite her precautions, her fear of the Abyssal Serpent sealed within him led her to trap him within the Realm of Shadow, where he would wage war to exterminate the Hornsent and devastate their lands. No matter how many of her enemies burned in his flame, however, Mesmer received no sign from Marika to end his crusade, and so resentfully cursed his mother for abandoning him. To hide away these actions and the true nature of her godhood, Marika hid the Realm of Shadow behind a magical veil to obscure it from public knowledge.

After Godfrey's banishment from the Lands Between, Marika took Radagon as second husband and King Consort, elevating him to become the second Elden Lord.[27] Radagon already had three children with Queen Rennala of the Carian Royal Family, and after his union with Marika, she would raise her new step-children, Radahn, Rykard and Ranni, to demigod status.[28]

Marika and Radagon would go on to have two more children of their own, the twins Malenia and Miquella,[29] who like Marika herself and Radagon's daughter Ranni, were Empyreans,[30] and were thus potential successors to Marika. However, Radagon and Marika were in truth the same. Radagon was described as Marika's male "other self".[31] Thus the twins were the children of a single god, and they were both born afflicted: Malenia with rotting sickness and Miquella with eternal childhood.[32]

Night of Black Knives
On the Night of Black Knives, a fragment of the Rune of Death was stolen from Maliketh.[33] For a long time it was not known who was behind the plot,[34] but it is finally revealed it was in fact Ranni who stole the fragment of the rune to forge godslaying black knives through a fearsome rite.[35]

The Black Knife Assassins, Numen women purported to have close ties to Marika herself,[36] used these knives to slay Godwyn the Golden, the first recorded death of a demigod in all history.[37] Queen Marika is said to have been driven to the brink by this event,[38] and some time later she shattered the Elden Ring using her hammer.[39] She had already instructed her demigod children to fight for the positions of Elden Lord and that of godhood.[40]

The Shattering
Marika shattered the Elden Ring
Fragments of the ring splintered into Great Runes and spread across the Lands Between, starting a conflict between her demigod children. War after war was fought, but there was no victor.[41] For her part, Marika would be imprisoned inside the Erdtree,[42] possibly by the Elden Beast or the Greater Will itself.[43]

True to her promise to Godfrey and his warriors, grace was restored to the banished Tarnished.[44] They would rise from their graves, and journey to the Lands Between to once again brandish the Elden Ring. The Tarnished formed the Roundtable Hold, where they worked to realize the goal given to them by Marika. They would be served by a Misbegotten blacksmith named Hewg, whom Marika herself had charged with smithing a "god-slaying weapon" before his imprisonment in the Hold.[45]
